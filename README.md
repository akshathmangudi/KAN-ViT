# A Detailed Investgation into KAN-based Vision Transformers. 

This is the official repository containing all details and code related to the project currently in progress, which is benchmarking KAN-based Vision Transformers versus the vanilla Vision Transformers from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929).

## Benchmark #1: 
The only thing changing in these benchmarks is the number of epochs that we are training the model for. 
**Optimizer: Adam, learning_rate = 0.005.**

| Model | Date of Training | #Epochs | Test Loss | Test Accuracy |
|:-----:|:------------------:|:-------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
| Vanilla ViT | 27-07-24 | 5 | TBD | TBD |
| KAN-ViT | 27-07-24 | 5 | TBD | TBD |

| Vanilla ViT | 26-07-24 | 8 | 1.94 | 52.07% |
| KAN-ViT | 26-07-24 | 8 | 1.67 | 79.44% |
